  <h1> the origin of books </h1>
  <p> The word book comes from Old English bōc, which in turn comes from the Germanic root *bōk-, cognate to 'beech'.[4] In Slavic languages like Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian буква bukva—'letter' is cognate with 'beech'. In Russian, Serbian and Macedonian, the word букварь (bukvar') or буквар (bukvar) refers to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing. It is thus conjectured that the earliest Indo-European writings may have been carved on beech wood.[5] The Latin word codex, meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant 'block of wood'.</p>
